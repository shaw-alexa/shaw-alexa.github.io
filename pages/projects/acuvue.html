    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>ACUVUE® is a premium contact lens brand manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. ACUVUE® services millions of 
      people worldwide providing them with a premium contact lens experience. Additionally, ACUVUE® collaborates 
      with eye care professionals to update them on the latest advancements in eye health. ACUVUE® is a leader in 
      the contact lens industry bringing innovation and technological advancements to millions of patients worldwide</p>

    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>ACUVUE® is looking for a way to effectively differentiate itself from competitors, show the value and 
      superiority of their product, and ensure optometrists entering the professional space use ACUVUE® lenses. 
      ACUVUE® contact lenses focus on comfort and design but come at a premium price. Additionally, once 
      professionals start recommending and utilizing a brand, they are unlikely to switch.</p>
   
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a mobile application with mini games and interactive elements optomery students can use at a conference.</li>
      <li>Design the experience to remain in the user’s browser so they don’t need to download an external application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I developed the high fidelity wireframes for the client using Figma and ensured that the design of the 
      application matched current ACUVUE® design standards. Additionally, I led development on the front-end of
      the application generating the ideas for the games and implementing them. I also worked on connecting the 
      front-end solution to the back-end ensuring all information could correctly be saved to the the database.</p>

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>The front-end of the application was built using React.js and CSS. The back-end was developed using Node.js 
      and MongoDB®. The final application included a sign up page and a main page for users to view activities. 
      The application included five mini games: trivia, anagrams, phrase guesser, odd one out, and memory. 
      A fedback survey was also included. Two interactive elements including a QR code for visiting the ACUVUE® 
      booth and attending a talk were included as interactive elements. A rewards shop was also included to 
      encourage users to continue playing to earn prizes.</p>

    <h4>Future Steps</h4>
    <p>The application is approved to be launched at an upcoming optomery conference.</p>

    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Beware of scope creep, particularly for projects with a quick turnaround time.</li>
      <li>Always have a particular audience you’re designing for.</li>
    </ul>
