    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>The Red Cross is one of the nation's first disaster relief organizations. The Red Cross provides
      emergency assistance and services during disasters. In addition, they provide medical support during 
      other events. Like many other emergency services organizations, the command systems to record events
      and communicate with command are antiquated, leaving room for improvement.</p>

    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>During certain events, the American Red Cross command staff experience difficulties in tracking the 
      movements of on-the-ground responders. The current method of tracking members creates communication 
      delays between command and response teams, reducing cohesion and hindering effectiveness during 
      time-sensitive operations. Thus, the team set out to develop a technical solution that could be 
      utilized by emergency responders during special events to better document incidents and communicate 
      with command.</p>
   
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish the designs for an updated communication system.</li>
      <li>Develop a functional prototype and conduct UX research.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I developed the wireframes for the user view of the application utilizing Figma. I was also involved
      in various parts of the user research portion of development, including contextual research, 
      card sorting, tree testing, and usability testing.</p>

    <h4>Contextual Research</h4>
    <p>The team began with contextual research to develop baseline knowledge on the types of injuries 
      occurring at large-scale events, EMS best practices at large events, and the features present in 
      incident command systems (ICS). Mass gatherings can include concerts, sporting events, religious 
      celebrations, street fairs, parades, and political rallies. Each event is unique, and estimation of 
      necessary resources can be derived from previous events of a similar nature. At large-scale events, 
      typical injuries include crush injuries, traumatic brain injuries, burns, lacerations, 
      heat exhaustion/dehydration, and substance abuse. To reduce the risk of injury, it’s crucial for 
      emergency responders to have a well-developed plan prior to providing medical care at events. The 
      utmost priority of emergency responders during events is scene safety and personnel safety. Lastly, 
      it should be discussed with the organizer whether post-event medical care will be provided.</p>

    <h4>Unstructured Interviews</h4>
    <p>Unstructured Interviews were conducted with two Red Cross members. The interviews provided insight into
       the current procedure for special event communication. Depending on the event, volunteers must 
       coordinate with nearby hospitals, deploy in high-risk locations, and attend a Red Cross briefing the 
       day before the event. During an event, volunteers typically engage in hourly communication with 
       command regarding team status, location, and observations. Following the conclusion of an event, 
       Go Teams must provide post-event updates on crowd movements or activities. </p>

    <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
    <p>Participants found that the wording used for “report and emergency” and “document an event” was 
      unclear. One participant mentioned that “document an event” was far too broad and needed to be broken 
      down into additional, more descriptive categories. Some suggestions for improved clarification included 
      having “documentation” as an overarching category, and within that category, include documentation for 
      admin (prep work, liaison work) and documentation for users (list emergency situation progress, record 
      notes). Updates included a revamped navigation bar, display of status information as a timeline as 
      opposed to icons, display of GPS location of assistance on the track status page, splitting reports into
       active and resolved emergencies, including announcements, check-in, and crowd condition reporting 
       functionality.</p>

    <h4>Concept Testing</h4>
    <p>Concept testing was conducted with the low-fidelity prototype; participants included members of 
      RPI Ambulance and personnel at the local firehouse. The feedback highlighted pain points in form 
      fields and documentation categories. The vast majority of documentation for events fell into a fairly
      predictable set of categories. Thus, the field for documenting an event was changed from a write-in
      field to a radio button format. This would allow for greater efficiency when logging events and
      standardization of data entry.</p>

    <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
    <p>Usability testing was conducted with a wide variety of potential users, including trained Red Cross 
      volunteers, first responders, and several individuals who were completely new to the system. Testing 
      was conducted with the finalized high-fidelity prototype. The vast majority of users were able to 
      complete the assigned tasks, demonstrating a minimal learning curve for the application. Other minor 
      changes included adjusting the expanded task view to a minus icon instead of an "x" to demonstrate 
      minimizing and expanding tasks as opposed to opening and closing them. Additionally, the input method
       for reporting resolved events was changed from radio buttons to a dropdown to accommodate a large 
       number of options.</p>

    <h4>Low Fidelity</h4>
    <p>Initial designs began as low-fidelity wireframes. These designs were developed following the 
      information gained from secondary research and unstructured interviews. The designs initially featured
      a page to track the status of emergencies, reporting emergencies, and documenting an event. A low to 
      medium fidelity update is pictured below. </p>

    <h4>Medium Fidelity</h4>
    <p>Following concept testing and card-sorting, designs were updated to medium-fidelity. The navigation bar 
    was redesigned and more specified information was included. Additional functionality was added to the 
    application including a section for announcements, check-in form, reporting crowd conditions functionality,
    and the ability to view and update submitted documents. The final set of tests, tree testing, and 
    usability testing all led to the final design wireframes. The following image shows the updates for the 
    track status page from medium fidelity to high fidelity.</p>

    <h4>High Fidelity</h4>
    <p>The navigation bar was finalized and track status was changed. Rather than display the timeline on the
      updates page, a general icon with the color and status were displayed. To view additional information,
      events could be expanded. To streamline reporting an emergency, a series of buttons were utilized. 
      Users can select an emergency type to view a form with prefilled information to simplify the 
      submission process. Document history was updated to an accordion format filtered by the specified 
      event that was occurring. Documentation for the current day was listed at the top with filtering 
      capabilities to see information from the last seven days.The expanded details for information regarding 
      submitted documents mirror the design of the active updates view for design consistency. To match the 
      user's mental models, the icon for the current location of a team was chosen as a flag to mirror teams 
      placing flags into the ground to showcase their current position to ensure help could find them. The image
      below shows updates to the form fields including a section for priority and documentaiton filtering.</p>
