    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The project consisted of a course querying application in which students can search for courses 
      containing particular keywords and add courses to a schedule panel. Course information was obtained 
      from the following openly-sourced Course Catalog Dataset from Data Science Discovery at the University 
      of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Data Science Discovery). The data was extracted from the repository, 
      transformed to ensure normalization, and then loaded into a relational database. An additional feature 
      of this application includes data visualizations. Statistics, including a breakdown of which 
      departments the student has registered for classes in, as well as complete breakdown of courses by 
      credit count, will be accessible. In summary, the application will have three main features. These 
      include adding courses to a schedule panel, querying courses for keywords, and viewing data 
      visualizations.</p>

    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Desgin a PostgreSQL database.</li>
      <li>Extract data from a CSV file and add it to a PostgreSQL database</li>
      <li>Develop a front-end interface to query the database and dynamically display results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>ETL</h4>
    <p>pgAdmin 4 was utilized to query and visualize the database. To establish relationships between certain
      tables, foreign keys were used. Information was downloaded from the Data Discovery Center website as a 
      CSV file. A staging table was created with all of the same rows present in the CSV file to allow for 
      easy information transfer. Certain information was edited in the CSV to allow for an easier transfer. 
      For instance, some start times of courses were listed as “arranged” as they were independent studies. 
      This was causing a break in the start time column of the staging table as the data type was listed as 
      “time.” To solve this issue, all rows containing start time as “arranged” were removed. 
      In total, the staging table contains 9,382 rows.</p>

    <h4>Keyword Assingment</h4>
    <p>Keywords were added to courses following the ETL process. A course_keyword table was developed matching
      specific courses with keywords. The table contained the course_id and keyword_id as foreign keys. Fifty
      keywords associated from college courses were utilized. Keywords were matched with courses by searching 
      for the keyword in the course name or description and attaching a keyword to said course if it was found.</p>
      
    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>The front-end of the application was developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The final
       application included the following pages: login, dashboard, courses, schedule, report, and account. 
       Logins were handled using localStorage. The dashboard page allowed students to get a quick overview 
       of what classes they were registered for and a snapshot of available courses. The course page 
       contained the full list of courses available as well as search and filter capabilities. The schedule
       page displayed a student's full schedule over the semester. The report page contained data 
       visualizations based on a student's registration status. The account contained information about the 
       student, including email and student status.</p>

    <h4>Future Steps</h4>
    <p>In the future, it would be great to include a responsive design so the website is useable on both 
      desktop and mobile. 
    </p>

    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A unique identifier in a table can be used as a primary key, generating a new random number for a 
        primary key is not always most efficient.</li>
      <li>Always design with the ability to scale in the future.</li>
    </ul>
