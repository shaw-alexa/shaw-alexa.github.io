    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>The challenge is to display all well-designed projects in a format that is both concise and informative. The 
      website needs to feature information about myself and the work I've completed while also being easily 
      maintainable so updates can be made in the future. A style guide should also be included so design standards 
      remain consistent after future updates.</p>
   
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Design high-fidelity wireframes of a portfolio website.</li>
      <li>Implement a portfolio website based on the previously designed wireframes that is viewable on both PC 
        and mobile.
      </li>
      <li>Create a style guide to ensure consitent designs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
    <p>The wireframes were developed using Figma. To complete the requirements of the project, three main pages were
       selected to design: a home page, a projects page, and an about page. You should be able to navigate to any 
       page from the current page you're on. An additional page was included to expand upon the work done for each 
       project. To allow for consistency a logo was designed for the website utilizing the shapes tools available in
        PowerPoint. Once a color scheme had been selected, all pages were designed to match these colors. Following 
        the design of each page, a prototype was developed to mimic navigation through each page.</p>

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>To allow for public accessibility of the project, the website was deployed using GitHub pages. The website 
      was implemented based on the high-fidelity wireframes designed in Figma. The website was created using HTML 
      and CSS for page content and JavaScript for link transitions and additional animations. A dark mode was later 
      included in the website to support those who prefer viewing websites in a darker format. The code was uploaded
      to a GitHub repository to ensure easy maintainability in the future.</p>
    <button class="dPurpleBtn" onclick="navHome('projectExpanded')">View Website</button>
    
    <h4>Style Guide</h4>
    <p>The information included in the style guide includes items such as logo size and color in both dark and light
       mode, font color, font sizes, button settings, and the overall color scheme of the website. The style guide 
       was developed to maintain consistent designs across the website. </p>

    <h4>Future Steps</h4>
    <p>The goal is to update the portfolio with any new projects that occur in the future.</p>

    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A style guide removes a lot of the guesswork when it comes to designing new pages.</li>
      <li>The final prototype will be very similar but will not always exactly match the final product.</li>
    </ul>
