    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>ITWS-6700 Software Development had a semester long group project in which teams were to develop a software solution. 
      The only requirement for said solution is that each team follow the software development process while building the
      application.
    </p>

    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>When attempting to schedule events in group environments, there are a number of challenges many individuals face. 
      These include differences in ideas for activities, confusion around the meeting time, or the issue of splitting costs when paying.
      Eventi aims to solve all of these issues. Eventi is a responsive web application in which users can create events
      and invite others to join said event allowing for collaboration. Additionally, individuals can record payments within
      the same application reducing the need for a number of applications for the same event. </p>
   
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a responsive web application allowing users to invite others to events, create and edit events, and record payments.</li>
      <li>Ensure multiple users can add activities to an event.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I worked on the UI/UX designer and developer for this project. I designed high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes, ran 
      usability tests, and worked on the front-end code for this application.
    </p>

    <h4>Software Development Process</h4>
    
    <h5>Planning</h5>
    <p>The team utilized an agile methodology to foster flexibiltiy during the development process. To keep track of tasks,
      the team used GitHub projects Kanban board. Each member of the group was assigned tickets and the tickets were closed 
      as tasks were completed.
    </p>

    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>The team settled on a responsive web design to allow for the use of a single code base and negate the need for users
      to download an app. Once an application type had been settled on, I began initial designs for the application displayed on 
      the left. The next phase was to conduct usability testing on the inital designs. A document listing the major takeaways
      of phase 1 of usability testing is included under the initial designs.These edits were incorporated into the next 
      iteration of the designs displayed under Phase 2 Designs. A second round of usability testing was conducted with the 
      designs from phase 2 to catch any lingering or novel issues with the design before moving into the production phase. 
      The results of the second round of usability testing are listed below the prototypes for phase 2.

    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>The front-end of the application was developed using React.js. All UI elements were built as reusable components
      improving efficency and ensuring a DRY (Don't Repeat Youself) codebase. Tailwind CSS was utilized for styling allowing
      for customizable styles to be included directly in the markup. For the back-end, Node,js, Express.js, APIs, 
      and a database with PostgreSQL hosted through Supabase were being utilized in development.

    <h5>Testing</h5>
    <p>The team conducted both functionality and usability testing for the application. Following the completion of the 
      development process, the team had a final round of usability testing on the live application with the results
      summarized below.

    <h5>Deployment</h5>
    <p>The project was containerized using Docker and deployed to an Azure virtual machine.</p>

    <h5>Maintanence</h5>
    <p>To allow for easy maintanence of the project, the team followed an organized folder structure and commented their code. 
      Additionally, we developed installation instructions to allow for local deployment as well as documenation of our database
      design and test cases and results.

    <h4>Future Steps</h4>
    <p>Given more time, the team would have loved to incorporate a map page to allow users to map out their route from
      one event to another. Additionally, incorporating a payment system directly into the system would take the application
      to the next level.
    </p>

    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop mobile layout concurently with PC layout.</li>
      <li>Be mindful of slight functionality differences between browsers.</li>
    </ul>
